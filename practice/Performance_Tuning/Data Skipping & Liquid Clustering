Data Skipping & Liquid Clustering


spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.io.skipping.metrics.enabled", "true")

Data Skipping is a performance optimization technique used in big data systems (like Databricks Delta Lake, Parquet,
 ORC) to avoid scanning irrelevant data blocks during queries. It’s essentially an I/O pruning method — instead of reading every file or row, 
the engine “skips” over files/blocks that don’t match the query filter.
